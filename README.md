# Build an Alfred workflow
Assemble the files within a source directory into an [Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) single package ready to be distributed.

The name of the output file is generated from the workflow name and version contained in the workflow's metadata.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

This action needs a file named `info.plist` with the metadata of your workflow in the root of your repo. This file is automatically generated for you when [exporting workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/sharing-workflows/) via the Alfred GUI.

### Inputs

* `workflow_dir`: Directory containing the sources of the workflow (defaults to `workflow`)
* `exclude_patterns`: List of excluded files/directories (optional)
* `custom_version`: String that will override the workflow version, e.g. a git tag (optional)

### Outputs

* `workflow_file`: The name of the created .alfredworkflow file

### Example workflow

On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gh-release) with the workflow file attached:
```yaml
name: Create Alfred Workflow

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build Alfred workflow
        id: builder
        uses: almibarss/build-alfred-workflow@v1
        with:
          workflow_dir: src
          exclude_patterns: '*.pyc *__pycache__/*'
          custom_version: ${{ github.ref_name }}

      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: ${{ steps.builder.outputs.workflow_file }}
```

## Additional files

In addition to the files and folders contained in the `workflow_dir` some other files are also implicitily shipped within the target `workflow_file`. These files are searched for in the root directory and are silently ignored in case they don't exist:

* `info.plist` (*required*)
* `icon.png`
* `README`, `README.md`

* `LICENSE`
